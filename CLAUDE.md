# Flutter Dependencies Manager CLI - Claude Context

## Project Status: MOSTLY COMPLETE ‚úÖ
- **Repository:** https://github.com/MarnesMukuru/flutter_deps_manager 
- **Current Release:** v1.0.8
- **Installation Working:** YES (installer fixed)
- **CLI Runtime Issue:** Needs one final fix

## Smart Installer - FULLY WORKING ‚úÖ
The smart installer (v1.0.8) is now completely functional:
- ‚úÖ Smart auto-detection (system-wide vs user installation)
- ‚úÖ Automatic PATH setup for user installations  
- ‚úÖ Clean output (fixed corruption bug)
- ‚úÖ Proper installation verification
- ‚úÖ Works with both sudo and non-sudo scenarios

**Installation command:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/MarnesMukuru/flutter_deps_manager/releases/download/v1.0.8/install.sh | bash
```

## Current Issue: CLI Runtime Bug üêõ

**Problem:** CLI installs successfully but fails at runtime with "Error"

**Root Cause:** Directory detection bug in `/usr/local/bin/flutter-deps-upgrade`
- CLI hardcodes `SCRIPT_DIR="/usr/local/lib/flutter-deps-upgrade"`
- Then overwrites it with wrong path: `SCRIPT_DIR=/usr/local/bin` 
- Can't find `core-functions.sh` which is in `/usr/local/lib/flutter-deps-upgrade/`

**Files Installed Correctly:**
- `/usr/local/bin/flutter-deps-upgrade` (executable)
- `/usr/local/lib/flutter-deps-upgrade/core-functions.sh` (support library)

## What Was Fixed This Session

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow ‚úÖ
- Fixed deprecation warnings by using modern actions
- Fixed workflow to preserve smart installer instead of overriding it

### 2. Build Script ‚úÖ
- Fixed `generate_web_installer()` to copy smart installer instead of generating basic one
- Removed 100+ lines of old installer generation code

### 3. Smart Installer ‚úÖ
- Created comprehensive installer with auto-detection and PATH setup
- Fixed output corruption bug (removed print statements from detection function)
- Added shell detection (zsh, bash, fish support)
- Added proper verification and user guidance

### 4. Repository Management ‚úÖ
- Made repository public for distribution
- Updated README with clear installation modes
- Removed test folders that weren't meant for commit
- Fixed all repository URLs throughout the codebase

## Next Steps (Final Fix Needed)

**Fix CLI directory detection in `flutter_deps_manager/flutter-deps-upgrade`:**

The CLI script needs to properly detect its library directory. Current problematic code:
```bash
SCRIPT_DIR="/usr/local/lib/flutter-deps-upgrade"  # Hardcoded
# Later gets overwritten incorrectly:
SCRIPT_DIR=$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)  # Wrong!
```

**Solution:** Fix the directory detection logic to find the correct library path.

## Build & Release Process - WORKING ‚úÖ
- GitHub Actions automatically builds releases on git tags
- Smart installer gets copied and version-updated correctly  
- All release assets upload properly
- No more warning or errors in CI/CD

## Testing Confirmed Working ‚úÖ
- Smart installer detects installation modes correctly
- PATH setup works automatically for user installations
- Repository URLs all correct throughout codebase
- GitHub releases contain proper smart installer
- Installation verification works (detects the CLI runtime bug correctly)

## File Locations
- **CLI Source:** `flutter_deps_manager/flutter-deps-upgrade`
- **Smart Installer:** `flutter_deps_manager/install.sh` 
- **Build Script:** `flutter_deps_manager/build.sh`
- **GitHub Actions:** `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- **Installation Test:** Lines 132-151 in `flutter_deps_manager/install.sh`

The project is 99% complete - just needs the CLI runtime directory detection fix!
